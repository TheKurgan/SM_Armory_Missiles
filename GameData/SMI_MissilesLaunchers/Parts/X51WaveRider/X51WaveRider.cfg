	description =  Boeing X51 WaveRider Missile is based on rumors and myths surrounding the High Speed Strike Weapon (HSSW), that is being developed by Lockheed Martin. It features JP-7 fueled/cooled SJY61 supersonic combustion ramjet , delivering speeds in excess of mach 6, and a flight altitude in excess of of 18km. This is the first functional prototype.
